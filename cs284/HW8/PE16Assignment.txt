Extend the class LinkedListClass by adding the following operations:
a. Find and delete the node with the smallest info in the list.
 (Delete only the first occurrence and traverse the list only once.)

b. Find and delete all occurrences of a given info from the list. 
(Traverse the list only once.) 

Add these as abstract functions in the class LinkedListClass and 
provide the definitions of these methods in the class UnorderedLinkedList.
Also test these functions in Driver program.
