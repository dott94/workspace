   * Task: Read the ciphertext from the file descriptor fin, decrypt it using
   *       sk, and place the resulting plaintext in a file named ptxt_fname.
   *
   * This procedure basically `undoes' the operations performed by pv_encrypt;
   * it expects a ciphertext featuring the following structure (please refer 
   * to the comments in edu_encrypt.c for more details):
   *
   *
   *         +--------------------------+---+
   *         |             Y            | W |
   *         +--------------------------+---+
   *
   * where Y = AES-CTR (K_CTR, plaintext)
   *       W = AES-CBC-MAC (K_MAC, Y)
   *
   * Note that the length of Y (in bytes) is not necessarily a
   * multiple of 16 (aes_blocklen) (it is just 16 bytes more than the
   * length of the original plaintext), whereas W is exactly 16-byte
   * long.  So to figure out the split between Y and W, you could
   * repeatedly attempt to perform `long read' of (2 * aes_blocklen +
   * 1) bytes: once we get to the end of the ciphertext and only the
   * last chunk of Y has to be read, such "long reads" will encounter
   * the end-of-file, at which point we will know where Y ends, and
   * how to finish reading the last bytes of the ciphertext.
